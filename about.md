Hi, My name is Shubham Goyal and I am Master's student at NC State University. I love the technology to the core and believe that it has become one of the most powerful agent to make an impact in almost every aspect of our life.
I have broad experience of coding in C++, Java, Python and Javascript. I was a full stack developer at Squadrun, where I was working on backend which was in Django and Android application.
